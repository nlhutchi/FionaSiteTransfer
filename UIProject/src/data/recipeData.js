        recipeDescription: "There is something so luxurious about parfaits to me — and I'm not just talking about when you have yogurt and granola for breakfast. A parfait to me means there’s at a minimum, fresh fruit, yogurt, and granola. This actually is not the actual definition of a parfait, but that’s beside the point (see the true definition here from Merriam Webster if you're curious… I was floored). Anyways, one of the fruits I'm lucky enough to have on constant rotation in Hawaii is papaya (a delicacy back home in California!). Its sweet, creaminess makes it the perfect complement to greek yogurt, and its shape makes it the perfect replacement for a bowl!",

            "1/2 papaya — seeds removed",

            "Fruit- I used 2 cherries and half a kiwi but you can use whatever you have on hand!",

            "Fill the inside of your papaya with yogurt. Note: the papaya is going to become your bowl and with each scoop of yogurt you can scoop into its flesh!",
            "Topping time! Stack your toppings atop your yogurt. Remember, you don't need to go toooo crazy because a lot of your fruit is coming from the papaya flesh itself!"

        notes: "This recipe is highly customizable! If you don't have any other fruit on hand, this is delicious just with the yogurt and papaya itself.",
