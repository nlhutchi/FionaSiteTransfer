But here's the thing- food and poetry aren't so far apart to me. Both are there to nourish us: one for your body and one for your mind. And both come from my heart to yoursâ€” hopefully, to make your life a little bit easier: whether that's in figuring out what to do in the kitchen or in reading something that helps you figure out what's going on in your mind.</Typography>
